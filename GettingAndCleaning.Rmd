# getting and cleaning the data

## tokenization

command taking a text file and returning token list (one per line)

```
head -n100 en_US.twitter.txt|tr -sc 'A-Za-z' ' '|tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]"|tr -s ' ' ' '| tr -sc 'A-Za-z' '\n'
```

command to cleanup a file. 

* match only alphabetic characters, thus removing puntuation and strange characters
* lower case everything to normalise
* remove extra spaces
* remove single letter occurrences except 'i', 'a' (TODO)

```
cat en_US.twitter.txt|  tr -sc 'A-Za-z' ' '|tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]"| tr -s ' ' ' ' > clean_twitter.txt
```

# profanity filterning

We download a list of profane terms to be used as a filter.

We choose the following list
<https://github.com/shutterstock/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/blob/master/en>

For each file, we filter each entry (i.e. line) containing at least one profane term.
```
cat en_US.twitter.txt| grep -vf en_profane_terms.txt en_US.twitter.txt

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
